```
The Transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al., revolutionized natural language processing by relying entirely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions. The model consists of an encoder and decoder, each composed of a stack of identical layers. Each layer has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization...

In the transformer model, the attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output. The output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key. We call our particular attention "Scaled Dot-Product Attention"...
