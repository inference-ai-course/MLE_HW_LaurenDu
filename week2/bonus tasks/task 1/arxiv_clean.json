In this paper, we manually analyze recent\nmultilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying\nseveral errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across\nseveral LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and\nidentify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages).

We demonstrate that this architecture achieves\n$2$--$10\\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers,\nmaintains $>95\\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and\nlearns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency\nmodeling.

To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of\nmagnitude larger than existing alternatives.

However, growing\nevidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by\nexcessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive\nreasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely\non outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which\nregulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale.

Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the\nmodel is prone to \"catastrophic forgetting\", resulting in the loss of\npreviously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,\nwe propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior\nupdate principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is\ninsensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the\nforgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the\nexisting CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update\nof the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution\nof the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of\nearly snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,\nwe propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly\ncombats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or\nchange amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We\nconduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results\nshow that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models."

Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to\nlinguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large\nlanguage models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon\nLLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,\ngenerating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an\nin-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a\npreviously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information\nbut also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality\nbias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both\nvisual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of\nuser-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet\neffective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we\nintervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,\nbalancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.\nFurthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's\noverreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our\nattention manipulation.

This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,\nmaking it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or\nfailure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.\nMethods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often\nyield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other\nhand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments\nfor each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision\nlabels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning\n(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method\nCredit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response\nrollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,\ngeneral-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to\ngenerate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable\ntoken-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned\nidentical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment\nin an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of\nCAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated\ncritiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen\nmodels and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms\nsupervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six\nchallenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks."

The framework integrates three core modules:\nTask Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature\nretrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop\noptimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated\ngeneration of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts\nwith differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to\ncollaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.\nWe demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,\nusing six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and\ncytokine stimulations across multiple modalities.

A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy\nand performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a\nfine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most\neffectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic\nempirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across\ndifferent levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training\nprocess into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage\nand plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism\nvaries across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our\nanalysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative\nsamples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn\ndrives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning\nefficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in\nlow-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by\nthese findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward\nsignal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on\ntokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to\nthe baseline methods on various LLMs."

This\ndual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational\ncomplexity of important information while retaining complete information,\nachieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational\nefficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive\nexperiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head\nattention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native\nsparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.\nMoreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also\ndemonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.\nCrucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly\noutperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the\nchallenging needle-in-a-haystack task.

Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated\nwith several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and\ntext-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current\ntoxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we\npropose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity\ndetection."

In this\npaper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS\noptimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves\nas the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of\nprogressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy\nconstraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness\nacross six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against\nstate-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance\non three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and\nGloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean\nand GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond\nANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning\ncan function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic\noptimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual\nrefinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN"

While\nprior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable\nsuch behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic\naccount of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how\nuser opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that\nsimple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise\nframing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal\nactivation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a\nlate-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.\nWe also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models\ndo not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical\nperspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts\n(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than\nthird-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger\nrepresentational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that\nsycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural\noverride of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment\nand truthful AI systems."

To address\nthis, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a\nflexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through\nattribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically\nmeaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes\nlow-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark\ndatasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves\nsubstantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while\nmaintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than\nalternative methods).

This limits\ntheir utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame\nsequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task\nattempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo\nRecursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose\nlong-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks\nwithin the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate\nreasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global\ncontext. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,\non diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa\nthat consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert\ntrajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong\nbaselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,\nframe-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We\nobserve that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each\ntimestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or\nnon-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the\nimplementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time\ncomplexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over\nbaselines.

We present PunGPT2,\nthe first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained\nfrom scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious\ntexts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches,\nPunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi\nthrough a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically\naligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall,\nwe introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining\nPunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We\nfurther develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant\nusing QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance\nwith significantly reduced compute needs.\n  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system\nthat fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic\nmatching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving\nvia quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual\nrelevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration\nof quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models\nsignificantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in\nperplexity, factuality, and fluency.

Due to its large dimensionality, the\nrepresentation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent\nare different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it\npossible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?\nSomewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable\nsubspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor\ndistance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an\nunsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in\nmany cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the\nsame abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to\n``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using\nknown circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and\ncircuit variables.

While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively\ndisambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit\nauthorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly\ndetecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these\nshortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging\nSelf-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology.

A blockchain-based trust registry records\nauthorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving\ncryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support\nconflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified\nauthorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications,\nincreasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and\nreviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in\nscholarly communication.

    "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on\nmassive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes\navailable. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual\npre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining\nfrom scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution\nshifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this\npaper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this\ndistribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay\nand gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the\nLlama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100\nbillion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and\ngradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This\nconclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and\ndiversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose\nan efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues\nexperience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible\ncompute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay\nrates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a\nmore valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more\ncompute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of\nreplaying old examples."

In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire\nsufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,\nwe decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge\ncontent learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose\nWeb-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and\nProcedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the\nagent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two\nknowledge types, representing the \"what\" of learning. Conversely, cognitive\nprocesses correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining\nthe \"how\" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we\nconstruct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world\nwebsites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web\nagent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the \"nouns\" upon\nwhich comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason\nand act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through\na novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing\nand training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner.

Our approach introduces a four-stage\nsynthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation,\ncultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This\npipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the\nNemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct\nlanguages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese.\nThe resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1,\ncomprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of\nLlama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning.\nThe final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual\ncontent safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on\nmultilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe\nresponses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a\nsignificant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling\nthe development of culturally aware safety guard models."

Our experiments\nshow that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage\nreduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that\nexpression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building\nprocess, and cannot be mitigated by prompting.

In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation\nparadigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly\nincorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the\nconventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier\nones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely\nthrough prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,\nwithout any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures\nBiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using\nsamples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is\nevaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all\nsettings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up\nto a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation.

Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we\nselectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST\nsubtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects\ngrammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves\nsyntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen\ncode patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating\nstructural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that\nsyntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based\nlanguage models in code generation tasks."

However,\nexisting SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant\nand low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and\nsuboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this\nproblem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and\nreasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility\nreflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence\nalone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but\nlack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly\ncomplex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this\nobservation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence\nQuadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence\nquadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient\ninfluence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.\nFurthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected\nsubsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is\nmore aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and\nevidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning\npatterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate\nthat DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match\nfull-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the\nbaseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over\nbrute-force scaling.

    "abstract": "A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require\nmulti-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the\ninternet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different\nlocations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often\nfocus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce\ntransactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required\nfor web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks\ntypically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not\nassess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,\nanalysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first\nend-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data\nscience tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data\nportals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,\nmulti-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats\nthat better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of\ncurrent SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing\nthese tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web\nVoyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis\nsuggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,\nrepetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks\ndisplay. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets\nthe stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful\nLLM-based data science."

One aspect of\ncontent restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via\nmodel alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need\nfor content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change\nrapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of\nharmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical\ndue to the high computational, data, and storage demands.

We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named\n\\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to\nany prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted\nterms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,\nincluding our SOP, we create a new \\textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}\n(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8\ncarefully selected categories.

However, some initial findings suggest that CoT\nreasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore\nfurther. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and\ninvestigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from\nin-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning\npaths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is\nfundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the\ntraining data and the test queries.

To address these limitations, we present\nDBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with\nknowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a\nheterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and\nproposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from\nthousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)\nreusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and\nimplicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps\nproposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis\npaths and identify missing relations automatically.

Due to the varying complexity of real-world\nqueries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost\nefficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an\nadaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent\norchestration.

While\nthe inference framework is rigid, we observe that the model itself possesses\ninternal signals that correlate with the optimal response length for a given\ntask. To bridge this gap, we leverage these latent signals and introduce\nDAEDAL, a novel training-free denoising strategy that enables Dynamic Adaptive\nLength Expansion for Diffusion Large Language Models. DAEDAL operates in two\nphases: 1) Before the denoising process, DAEDAL starts from a short initial\nlength and iteratively expands it to a coarse task-appropriate length, guided\nby a sequence completion metric. 2) During the denoising process, DAEDAL\ndynamically intervenes by pinpointing and expanding insufficient generation\nregions through mask token insertion, ensuring the final output is fully\ndeveloped. Extensive experiments on DLLMs demonstrate that DAEDAL achieves\nperformance comparable, and in some cases superior, to meticulously tuned\nfixed-length baselines, while simultaneously enhancing computational efficiency\nby achieving a higher effective token ratio.

Agentic retrieval significantly improved mean diagnostic\naccuracy over zero-shot prompting (73% vs. 64%; P<0.001) and conventional\nonline RAG (73% vs. 68%; P<0.001). The greatest gains occurred in mid-sized\nmodels (e.g., Mistral Large improved from 72% to 81%) and small-scale models\n(e.g., Qwen 2.5-7B improved from 55% to 71%), while very large models (>200B\nparameters) demonstrated minimal changes (<2% improvement). Additionally,\nagentic retrieval reduced hallucinations (mean 9.4%) and retrieved clinically\nrelevant context in 46% of cases, substantially aiding factual grounding. Even\nclinically fine-tuned models exhibited meaningful improvements (e.g.,\nMedGemma-27B improved from 71% to 81%), indicating complementary roles of\nretrieval and fine-tuning. These results highlight the potential of agentic\nframeworks to enhance factuality and diagnostic accuracy in radiology QA,\nparticularly among mid-sized LLMs, warranting future studies to validate their\nclinical utility."

    "abstract": "Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to interpret natural language\nqueries and perform structured reasoning over knowledge graphs by leveraging\ntheir relational and semantic structures to retrieve accurate answers. Recent\nKGQA methods primarily follow either retrieve-then-reason paradigm, relying on\nGNNs or heuristic rules for static paths extraction, or dynamic path generation\nstrategies that use large language models (LLMs) with prompting to jointly\nperform retrieval and reasoning. However, the former suffers from limited\nadaptability due to static path extraction and lack of contextual refinement,\nwhile the latter incurs high computational costs and struggles with accurate\npath evaluation due to reliance on fixed scoring functions and extensive LLM\ncalls. To address these issues, this paper proposes Dynamically Adaptive\nMCTS-based Reasoning (DAMR), a novel framework that integrates symbolic search\nwith adaptive path evaluation for efficient and context-aware KGQA. DAMR\nemploys a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) backbone guided by an LLM-based\nplanner, which selects top-$k$ relevant relations at each step to reduce search\nspace. To improve path evaluation accuracy, we introduce a lightweight\nTransformer-based scorer that performs context-aware plausibility estimation by\njointly encoding the question and relation sequence through cross-attention,\nenabling the model to capture fine-grained semantic shifts during multi-hop\nreasoning. Furthermore, to alleviate the scarcity of high-quality supervision,\nDAMR incorporates a dynamic pseudo-path refinement mechanism that periodically\ngenerates training signals from partial paths explored during search, allowing\nthe scorer to continuously adapt to the evolving distribution of reasoning\ntrajectories. Extensive experiments on multiple KGQA benchmarks show that DAMR\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."

    "abstract": "Jailbreaking is an essential adversarial technique for red-teaming these\nmodels to uncover and patch security flaws. However, existing jailbreak methods\nface significant drawbacks. Token-level jailbreak attacks often produce\nincoherent or unreadable inputs and exhibit poor transferability, while\nprompt-level attacks lack scalability and rely heavily on manual effort and\nhuman ingenuity. We propose a concise and effective two-stage framework that\ncombines the advantages of these approaches. The first stage performs a\nscenario-based generation of context and rephrases the original malicious query\nto obscure its harmful intent. The second stage then utilizes information from\nthe model's hidden states to guide fine-grained edits, effectively steering the\nmodel's internal representation of the input from a malicious toward a benign\none. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method achieves\nstate-of-the-art Attack Success Rate, with gains of up to 37.74% over the\nstrongest baseline, and exhibits excellent transferability to black-box models.\nOur analysis further demonstrates that AGILE maintains substantial\neffectiveness against prominent defense mechanisms, highlighting the\nlimitations of current safeguards and providing valuable insights for future\ndefense development.

However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines\nthe performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we\npropose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism\ninspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two\nspecialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing\nmassive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the\nmodel's constrained context.

Unlike previous work, we directly link\nprosody and emoji by analysing actual human speech data, collected through\nstructured but open-ended production and perception tasks. This provides\nempirical evidence of how emoji semantics shape spoken delivery and perception.\nResults show that speakers adapt their prosody based on emoji cues, listeners\ncan often identify the intended emoji from prosodic variation alone, and\ngreater semantic differences between emojis correspond to increased prosodic\ndivergence.

Our objective is twofold: (1) to assess the state of the\nart of classification formalisms and their limitations, and (2) to identify the\nconceptual primitives and mathematical frameworks for a more powerful,\nreconstructive approach.\n  Based on a synthesis of 74 primary studies, we find that existing taxonomies\nlack conceptual granularity, a unified formal basis, and struggle with hybrid\nlanguages. In response, our analysis reveals a strong convergence toward a\ncompositional reconstruction of paradigms. This approach identifies a minimal\nset of orthogonal, atomic primitives and leverages mathematical frameworks,\npredominantly Type theory, Category theory and Unifying Theories of Programming\n(UTP), to formally guarantee their compositional properties.\n  We conclude that the literature reflects a significant intellectual shift\naway from classification towards these promising formal, reconstructive\nframeworks.

We propose a classification\nframework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and\nactive learning.

The\nevaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy\non AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with\nminimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,\nrespectively).

Sharpness-Aware\nMinimization (SAM) improves model generalization for both Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) and Transformers by encouraging convergence to locally flat\nminima. However, the connection between sharpness and generalization has not\nbeen fully explored for LoRA due to the lack of tools to either empirically\nseek flat minima or develop theoretical methods. In this work, we propose\nFlat-LoRA and its efficient version i.e., EFlat-LoRA, to seek flat minima for\nLoRA. Concretely, we theoretically demonstrate that perturbations in the full\nparameter space can be transferred to the low-rank subspace. This approach\neliminates the potential interference introduced by perturbations across\nmultiple matrices in the low-rank subspace. Our extensive experiments on large\nlanguage models and vision-language models demonstrate that EFlat-LoRA achieves\noptimize efficiency comparable to that of LoRA while simultaneously attaining\ncomparable or even better performance. For example, on the GLUE dataset with\nRoBERTa-large, EFlat-LoRA outperforms LoRA and full fine-tuning by 1.0% and\n0.5% on average, respectively. On vision-language models e.g., Qwen-VL-Chat\nshows performance improvements of 1.5% and 1.0% on SQA and VizWiz datasets,\nrespectively.

To effectively evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in this domain, it\nis crucial to have a well-designed benchmark that accurately reflects\nreal-world scenarios and mitigates common pitfalls. Existing LLM test\ngeneration benchmarks are limited by two critical drawbacks: data contamination\nand structurally simple function code. As a result, we often cannot rely on the\nvalidity of scientific conclusions drawn from empirical studies using these\nlimited benchmarks. The empirical evidence presented may be biased due to\ncontamination and may fail to generalize beyond toy programs due to structural\nsimplicity.\n  To address these problems, we introduce ULT (UnLeakedTestbench), a new\nbenchmark specifically designed for function-level unit test generation from\nreal-world Python functions. ULT is constructed through a multi-stage curation\nprocess that ensures high cyclomatic complexity and mitigates test case\ncontamination. With 3,909 carefully selected function-level tasks, ULT provides\na more realistic and challenging evaluation of LLMs' test generation\ncapabilities. We also provide PLT (PreLeakedTestbench), a pair benchmark of ULT\nwith leaked tests designed to enable a controlled analysis of memorization\nversus reasoning in test generation.

Considering that current demonstration selection methods primarily focus\non the relevance to the user query while overlooking the information that the\nmodel has already assimilated, we propose a novel method called GradS, which\nleverages gradient flow for demonstration selection. We use the magnitude of\nthe gradient flow of the demonstration with respect to a given user query as\nthe criterion, thereby ensuring the effectiveness of the chosen ones. We\nvalidate our derivation and GradS on four prominent LLMs across five mainstream\ndatasets.

These changes are widely attributed\nto the growing influence of Large Language Models (LLMs), which frequently rely\non a distinct lexical style. Divergences between model output and target\naudience norms can be viewed as a form of misalignment. While these shifts are\noften linked to using Artificial Intelligence (AI) directly as a tool to\ngenerate text, it remains unclear whether the changes reflect broader changes\nin the human language system itself. To explore this question, we constructed a\ndataset of 22.1 million words from unscripted spoken language drawn from\nconversational science and technology podcasts. We analyzed lexical trends\nbefore and after ChatGPT's release in 2022, focusing on commonly LLM-associated\nwords.

In contrast, baseline synonym words exhibit no\nsignificant directional shift.

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce FACTORY, a large-scale, human-verified prompt set.\nDeveloped using a model-in-the-loop approach and refined by humans, FACTORY\nincludes challenging prompts that are fact-seeking, answerable, and\nunambiguous. We conduct human evaluations on 6 state-of-the-art language models\nusing FACTORY and existing datasets. Our results show that FACTORY is a\nchallenging benchmark: approximately 40% of the claims made in the responses of\nSOTA models are not factual, compared to only 10% for other datasets. Our\nanalysis identifies the strengths of FACTORY over prior benchmarks, emphasizing\nits reliability and the necessity for models to reason across long-tailed\nfacts."

    "abstract": "Greater theorizing of methods in the computational humanities is needed for\nepistemological and interpretive clarity, and therefore the maturation of the\nfield. In this paper, we frame such modeling work as engaging in translation\nwork from a cultural, linguistic domain into a computational, mathematical\ndomain, and back again. Translators benefit from articulating the theory of\ntheir translation process, and so do computational humanists in their work --\nto ensure internal consistency, avoid subtle yet consequential translation\nerrors, and facilitate interpretive transparency. Our contribution in this\npaper is to lay out a particularly consequential dimension of the lack of\ntheorizing and the sorts of translation errors that emerge in our modeling\npractices as a result. Along these lines we introduce the idea of semiotic\ncomplexity as the degree to which the meaning of some text may vary across\ninterpretive lenses, and make the case that dominant modeling practices --\nespecially around evaluation -- commit a translation error by treating\nsemiotically complex data as semiotically simple when it seems\nepistemologically convenient by conferring superficial clarity. We then lay out\nseveral recommendations for researchers to better account for these\nepistemological issues in their own work."

    "abstract": "The degree to which LLMs produce writing that is truly human-like remains\nunclear despite the extensive empirical attention that this question has\nreceived. The present study addresses this question from the perspective of\nlexical diversity. Specifically, the study investigates patterns of lexical\ndiversity in LLM-generated texts from four ChatGPT models (-3.5, -4, -o4 mini,\nand -4.5) in comparison with texts written by L1 and L2 English participants (n\n= 240) across four education levels. Six dimensions of lexical diversity were\nmeasured in each text: volume, abundance, variety-repetition, evenness,\ndisparity, and dispersion. Results from one-way MANOVAs, one-way ANOVAS, and\nSupport Vector Machines revealed that the LLM-generated texts differed\nsignificantly from human-written texts for each variable, with ChatGPT-o4 mini\nand -4.5 differing the most. Within these two groups, ChatGPT-4.5 demonstrated\nhigher levels of lexical diversity despite producing fewer tokens. The human\nwriters' lexical diversity did not differ across subgroups (i.e., education,\nlanguage status). Altogether, the results indicate that LLMs do not produce\nhuman-like texts in relation to lexical diversity, and the newer LLMs produce\nless human-like texts than older models. We discuss the implications of these\nresults for language pedagogy and related applications."

This domain has recently witnessed rapid\ndevelopment and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application\npotential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based\ncode generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from\nits inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both\nsingle-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details\nthe applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes\nmainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative\ntools.

This approach collects model\nresponses in a stagewise manner with each stage revealing partial information\nabout the question designed to elicit generalized reasoning in LLMs. We find\nthat our approach not only provides a better comparison between LLMs, but also\ninduces better intermediate traces in models compared to the standard QA\nparadigm. We empirically verify this behavior on diverse reasoning and\nknowledge-heavy QA datasets by comparing LLMs of varying sizes and families.\nOur approach narrows the performance gap observed in the standard QA evaluation\nsettings, indicating that the prevalent indirect QA paradigm of evaluation\noverestimates the differences in performance between models.
