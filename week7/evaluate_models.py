This includes generating high-quality images with complex reasoning and detailed descriptions.",

During training, noise is systematically added to images, and the model learns to predict and remove this noise iteratively, enabling high-quality image synthesis through this learned reverse process.",

This approach enhances accuracy and reduces hallucination by grounding responses in retrieved relevant documents, enabling models to access up-to-date information beyond their training data.",

Current methods struggle with maintaining consistency over millions of tokens.",

They establish common datasets, metrics, and protocols that facilitate reproducible research and track progress in the field, though gaps exist in areas like long-context understanding and complex reasoning tasks.",

This parallel processing approach, combined with positional encodings, enables efficient modeling of long-range dependencies without the sequential limitations of recurrent architectures.",
