Hi there! 👋 Welcome to my Generative AI & Machine Learning Hub!

This repository documents my journey through the **Machine Learning Engineer in the Generative AI Era** course — a hands-on, project-based exploration of cutting-edge AI tools and methods.

You'll find my work with:

🧠 **Large Language Models** – Prompt engineering, transformers, fine-tuning, and alignment  
🛠️ **Open-Source AI Tools** – LangChain, HuggingFace, vLLM, MCP protocol  
📦 **Practical ML** – RAG pipelines, data scraping/cleaning, model evaluation  
🎙️ **Multimodal AI** – Voice agents, TTS/ASR pipelines, real-time interfaces  
🤖 **Agentic Workflows** – Custom research agent with automation and memory  

From lectures to homework to a final capstone project, this repo showcases my hands-on learning and technical growth. Feel free to explore, fork, and connect!
